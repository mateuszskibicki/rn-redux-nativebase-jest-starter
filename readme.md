# React (16.8+ Hooks!) / React-Native / Redux

### Expo CLI (sdk 35) / Redux / React-Navigation (v4) / Typescript / Jest

Setup is ready with navigation auth flow (createStackNavigator, createMaterialBottomTabNavigator, createAppContainer, createSwitchNavigator) and you've got:

- AuthLoading (initialRouteName -> here it will check for token and go to Auth or Home)
- AuthLogout (remove token and go to Auth)
- Auth (Login/Logout screens)
- Home (main part with app)
